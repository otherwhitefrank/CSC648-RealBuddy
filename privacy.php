                <p>
                    Welcome!  We at Realbuddy are providing this Privacy Policy to explain our 
                    practices regarding collecting and using information from users of the Realbuddy service.  
                    Realbuddy respects the privacy of all of its users, and the following 
                    details how we use the information we collect from you. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="dark-grey">To Whom Does This Privacy Policy Apply?</h4>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy applies to anyone who uses our services, 
                    particularly to users who register to our site.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h4 class="dark-grey">What Do We Collect?</h4>
                <p> 
                    We collect any information you provide when using our services.  
                    This occurs when creating an account, submitting a listing to sell, 
                    or searching for houses via the search button.  In regards to registering
                    for our service, we ask you to provide us with certain personal identifiable
                    information such as your name, email, home address and phone number. 
                    We also keep a record of your favorite listings as well as any listings you submit.<br><br>

                <h4 class="dark-grey">How Do We Use Your Information? </h4>
                <p>
                    We use your information to provide a service to you.  When you request 
                    contact with a real estate agent, we provide personal information to 
                    the agent as a means of telling the agent who you are.  When searching 
                    for houses, we use the housing information you provide to list all of 
                    the possible listings for sale.  We may also use housing information you 
                    provide when displaying featured houses on Realbuddyâ€™s home page.
                </p>

                    In the event of a change in your personal information, you can access and

                    customer service.  We implore that you keep your information up to date

                    information may remain archived for our records or as required by law.
